IMPLEMENTATION CODE:
{config_code if config_code else "Not provided"}

For each aspect of the experimental design, compare:
1. Participant characteristics (N, demographics, recruitment)
2. Experimental procedure and steps
3. Materials and stimuli - CRITICAL: Questions/tasks must be almost exactly the same, only formatting differences are allowed
4. Dependent variables and measures
5. Statistical analyses
6. Conditions and manipulations

IMPORTANT: For questions, tasks, and stimuli:
- They must be almost exactly the same as in the original paper
- Only formatting differences (e.g., whitespace, line breaks, markdown formatting) are acceptable
- Any changes to wording, content, or meaning are considered inconsistencies

For each inconsistency found:
- Mark whether it's an intentional modification or an error
- Provide the original paper's description
- Provide the benchmark's implementation
- Suggest validation methods to verify the modification is acceptable
- Note if the modification affects replicability
