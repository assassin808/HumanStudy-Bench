Please analyze:
1. List ALL experiments/studies mentioned in the original paper that contain statistical (quantitative) data
2. For each experiment, determine if it is replicable using LLM:
   - NOT replicable if it requires: visual input, time sense/perception, or lacks quantitative data
   - IS replicable if it involves: emotional simulation, problem-solving, role-playing, hypothetical scenarios, or any text-based tasks with quantitative outcomes
3. Check if each LLM-replicable experiment with statistical data is included in the benchmark implementation
4. Identify any missing experiments
5. Note any experiments that were intentionally excluded and why (if stated)

IMPORTANT: Only include experiments that have statistical (quantitative) data reported in the paper.
